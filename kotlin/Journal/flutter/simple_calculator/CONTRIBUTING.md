### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed (3.6.2+)
2. Clone your fork of the repository
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
4. Run `flutter analyze` to check for any issues
5. Run `flutter test` to run the test suite

## Style Guide

### Dart Style Guide

- Follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `flutter format .` to format your code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Flutter/Dart Conventions

- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Prefer `final` over `var` where possible
- Use trailing commas in parameter lists and collection literals
- Organize imports: dart libraries, package libraries, relative imports
- Use `late` keyword appropriately for non-nullable variables

## Project Structure Guidelines

When adding new features, please follow the existing project structure:

- **Models** (`lib/models/`): Data models and business logic
- **Screens** (`lib/screens/`): Full-screen widgets
- **Widgets** (`lib/widgets/`): Reusable UI components
- **Utils** (`lib/utils/`): Utility functions and helpers (if needed)

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Documentation Guidelines

- Update the README.md for new features
- Add inline code documentation for complex logic
- Include examples in documentation where helpful
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
